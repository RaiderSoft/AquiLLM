## Getting Started (End Users)

This guide provides detailed steps for users less familiar with development tools.

### Step 1: Install Docker Desktop

Docker is required to run AquiLLM. Follow these instructions for your operating system:

#### Windows
1. Download Docker Desktop from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Double-click the installer (.exe file) and follow the installation wizard
3. When prompted, ensure the "Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V" option is selected (if available)
4. After installation, restart your computer
5. Docker Desktop should start automatically. Look for the Docker icon in your system tray

#### Mac
1. Download Docker Desktop for Mac from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - For Intel Macs: Choose the Intel chip option
   - For newer Macs with M1/M2 chips: Choose the Apple chip option
2. Open the downloaded .dmg file
3. Drag the Docker icon to the Applications folder
4. Open Docker from your Applications folder
5. You may need to provide administrator permissions during first launch

#### Ubuntu Linux
1. Open Terminal (press Ctrl+Alt+T)
2. Update your package index:
   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   ```
3. Install necessary packages:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
   ```
4. Add Docker's official GPG key:
   ```
   sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
   sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
   ```
5. Set up the repository:
   ```
   echo "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
   ```
6. Update package index again:
   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   ```
7. Install Docker packages:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
   ```
8. Verify Docker is installed correctly:
   ```
   sudo docker run hello-world
   ```

### Step 2: Download AquiLLM

1. Download this repository by clicking the green "Code" button on the GitHub page and selecting "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the ZIP file to a location on your computer where you can easily find it (like your Desktop)

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

AquiLLM requires several environment variables to be set up for proper operation. The application uses these variables to connect to various services like the database, storage, and AI providers.

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open the `.env` file in a text editor and configure the following critical settings:

   - **LLM API Keys**: At least one of these is REQUIRED:
     - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: For Claude models (recommended)
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For GPT models
     - `GEMINI_API_KEY`: For Google Gemini models
     - Set `LLM_CHOICE` to your preferred provider (`CLAUDE`, `OPENAI`, or `GEMINI`)

   - **Authentication (Optional for Development)**: The application can use Google OAuth for login in production
     - `GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET`: Create these at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
     - `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS`: Comma-separated list of email domains that can register (e.g., `example.edu,example.org`)
     - `ALLOWED_EMAIL_ADDRESSES`: Specific email addresses allowed to access the application
     - **For development, you can skip this and create a superuser instead**

   - **Other Settings**:
     - `HOST_NAME`: Your domain name (for production) or `localhost` (for development)
     - Database and Storage settings (default values in .env.example work with Docker Compose)

   For development purposes, the default setting is:
   ```
   DJANGO_DEBUG=1
   ```

### Step 4: Run AquiLLM (First Time)

1. Open a command prompt/terminal:
   - Windows: Press Win+R, type "cmd" and press Enter
   - Mac: Open Terminal from Applications > Utilities
   - Ubuntu: Press Ctrl+Alt+T

2. Navigate to the AquiLLM folder:
   ```
   cd path/to/AquiLLM
   ```
   (Replace "path/to/AquiLLM" with the actual path where you extracted the files)

3. Build and start the application for the first time:
   ```
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   This will take several minutes to complete. You'll see lots of text output as the application builds and starts.

4. Create a user account. Open a new command prompt/terminal window (keep the first one running) and run:
   ```
   docker compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
   Follow the prompts to create your username, email, and password.

5. When you see messages that look like the application is ready (such as "Starting development server"), open your web browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

6. Log in with the superuser credentials you just created

### Step 5: Using AquiLLM After Installation

After you've built AquiLLM once, you can start it faster next time:

1. Open a command prompt/terminal
2. Navigate to the AquiLLM folder:
   ```
   cd path/to/AquiLLM
   ```
3. Start the application:
   ```
   docker compose up web
   ```
4. Open your web browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```
5. Log in with your superuser credentials

### Step 6: Stopping AquiLLM

To stop AquiLLM:
1. Go to the command prompt/terminal where it's running
2. Press Ctrl+C
3. Wait for the application to shut down gracefully
